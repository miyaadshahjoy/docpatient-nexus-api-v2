## 🚀 Features

### 🛡 Authentication & Authorization

- Secure **JWT-based** authentication
  - Use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to implement stateless authentication across all user roles (Patients, Doctors, Admins, Super Admins)
  - JWT generation after a successful login and signing with a secure server-side secret
  - JWT invalidation on logout
  - Token includes:
    - **id**: User ID
    - **role**: Access control role
    - **iat, exp**: Issued-at and expiration timestamps
  - All protected routes requiring a valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
  - Custom middleware (authController.protect) verifying token integrity, expiration, and user existence.
  - Role-based access control via restrictTo(...) middleware enforces granular permissions (e.g. only Doctors can prescribe).
  - Sub-role support for admins (e.g. ['admin', 'appointment-manager']) adds fine-grained authorization control.
  - JWT token revokation on user password change using the passwordChangedAt field.

- Role-based access control: `super-admin`, `admin`, `doctor`, `patient`
- Identity-based access enforcement
- Email verification with expiration
- Password hashing, reset, and update
- Account status checks: active, pending, removed

### 🛢 Redis setup for BullMQ

- Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data store that's often used as a database, cache, and message broker.
- Redis is used as a queue for sending email notifications and reminders in this application.
- This project uses `BullMQ` for job scheduling and background processing, which requires a `Redis` server to function.
- Go to [https://cloud.redis.io/#/databases](https://cloud.redis.io/#/databases) to create a free Redis database.
- Install Redis

```bash
npm install ioredis
```

- Configure Redis connection in your `.env` file:

```bash
REDIS_HOST=YOUR_REDIS_HOST
REDIS_PORT=YOUR_REDIS_PORT
REDIS_USERNAME=YOUR_REDIS_USERNAME (default: default)
REDIS_PASSWORD=YOUR_REDIS_PASSWORD
```

- Create a Redis client in your application:

```javascript
const { Redis } = require('ioredis');
const redisClient = new Redis({
  username: process.env.REDIS_USERNAME,
  password: process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD,
  maxRetriesPerRequest: null,

  host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
  port: process.env.REDIS_PORT,
});
```

- Go to the [Redis documentation](https://redis.io/documentation) for more information on how to set up and use Redis.
